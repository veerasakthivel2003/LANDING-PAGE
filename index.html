            <p> Ancient Egypt:<br>
                The earliest recorded evidence of cake-making is from ancient Egypt, where cakes were baked as offerings to the gods.</p> 
             <p>Mid-17th century Europe:<br>
                The precursors of modern cakes were first baked in Europe, thanks to advances in technology and access to ingredients. These cakes were round and topped with icing, which was usually a boiled mixture of sugar, egg whites, and flavorings.</p>
            <p>19th century:<br>
                Cakes became more popular, but were still considered a luxury because sweet ingredients like sugar and chocolate were expensive.</p>   
            <p>Today:<br>
                Cakes have taken on many forms and are enjoyed by people all over the world.</p>

            <p>It is a derivation of 'kaka', an Old Norse word. Medieval European bakers often made fruitcakes and gingerbread. These foods could last for many months. According to the food historians, the precursors of modern cakes (round ones with icing) were first baked in Europe sometime in the mid-17th century.</p>
